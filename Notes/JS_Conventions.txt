Javascript uses camel casing; means that the first letter of the first word is lowercased while ever word after starts with an uppercase. (firstName or inMyIndex)

 Javascript doesn't read whitespace so too many spaces or no space doe the same as one space.

 // comments

querySelector will always select only the first element it finds that matches the query.
    var result = document.querySelector("#favorite-things")
    console.log(result)

querySelectorAll will select all elements that match the query.
    var result = document.querySelectorAll("#favorite-things")
    console.log(result)
