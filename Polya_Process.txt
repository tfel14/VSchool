### Polya's Process

In order to effectively solve this problem we need to use a method for solving problems developed for mathematician George Polya.

1. Understand the problem. Do you understand what the problem is asking of us? If not, either re-read and try to explain it to yourself in your own words or ask for further clarification. Determine the data and the unknowns. Once we've truly understood the problem we can identify what data we have and what we don't have. Is the data we have sufficient to solve the condition of the problem? If not, what data would we need to do that?
2. Make a plan. Once we've understood the problem and reviewed the data and unknowns, we are ready to make a plan of action to solve this problem. Along the way, we'll ask ourselves some other questions, like, have we seen a problem similar to this one that we could use the same method to solve it? Is there an established way of dealing with this type of problem that you've learned? etc. The best way to make a plan is to break the problem down into smaller pieces or steps that we'll solve one by one. This is usually done by beginning to write pseudo-code.
3. Carry out the plan. The execution of the plan will involve attempting to solve each little piece or step while checking to ensure that the outcome is what we expected. Code is easier to debug if it's done in small steps rather than attempting to solve the problem to completion and then checking it.
4. Looking back. Can we check and prove the the result is correct? Now that we have a completed answer is there any way we can optimize it? Is this solution going to handle all of the potential use cases? Can our solution or parts of it be reused for another similar task? Or can code we've already written replace pieces of our solution?

Often times when we're executing a plan we may realize that there is step we hadn't planned out yet, especially if the plan is large or the task is more complicated with more steps. Feel free to stop at anytime and figure out how to do something. In this case, we need to figure out how to get the number of voters in each group that have actually voted and then the total number in each group and calculate the percentage with it.

In the end, big problems are merely made up of smaller, more manageable problems, most of which you can either solve or learn how to solve fairly quickly.
